              <p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Translator: Fr06t</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">Editor: Fr06t</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">TN: I'm in quite a rush since I'm planning to head to my parents' place for this weekend. I wanted to get something out so I released this. It's quite badly translated but I could get the gist of it out at least. I could only edit it a bit too. Thanks!<br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">________________________________________________________________<br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana;">"Hey, poor man! I've heard you don't plan to join His Highness Julius's volunteer army,"<br><br>Alan, with his cronies, is talking to us in the classroom.<br><br>I'm surrounded by Marie, Daniel, and Raymond.<br><br>Marie raises one eyebrow.<br><br>"What? Too bad you're poor? You posh boy!"<br><br>"No, no, not you."<br><br>Alan can't come out strong against Marie, who is a girl. Just looking at her makes boys feel a sense of intimacy.<br><br>Because of Alan's shouting in the classroom, the students around us were paying attention to us.<br><br>Raymond seemed to think it was a bad idea.<br><br>"Guys, let's get out of the classroom. This situation is bad."<br><br>As if to interrupt Raymond's thoughts, Alan used his cronies to block our escape route.<br><br>"You're running away?"<br><br>Looking at the grinning Alan and the others, I feel disgusted.<br><br>It isn't a problem if a nobleman doesn't join His Highness Julius's volunteer army. Rather, it would be better if he managed to disband it.<br><br>However, the atmosphere in the school did not allow for that.<br><br>It's not just the boys around us, even the girls are giving us cold looks.<br><br>Daniel looked at Alan and the others in frustration and muttered in a whisper, "It's dirty."<br><br>You are free to join the volunteer army. However, refusing to do so would put you in a bad position in the school.<br><br>This is because many boys, and to a lesser extent, girls, have also announced their participation in the volunteer army.<br><br>In other words, we are in the minority.<br><br>No matter how good of an argument we make, our position cancels it out.<br><br>It's called peer pressure.<br><br>Alan talks loudly in front of everyone, on purpose.<br><br>"Bartford, you have an airship, don't you? I've heard it's a fine airship acquired through adventure. So how can you not join the volunteer army? Isn't this where a real nobleman would have volunteered to take the lead? If I were you, I would have volunteered on the spot when I heard His Highness Julius' speech."<br><br>"I am not you and you are not me. Such metaphors are pointless."<br><br>It's so embarrassing. It's like an amateur who watches a boxing match, doesn't know anything about it, and says something like, "I would have definitely been able to avoid that straight up now!"<br><br>But Alan, with his surroundings on his side, was bullish.<br><br>"You're running away, coward?"<br><br>We haven't even participated in the war, but they're treating us like cowards deserting it.<br><br>Humans are really stupid.<br><br>Marie steps forward to defend me and says what she wants to Alan.<br><br>"Joining a volunteer army isn't compulsory. Don't make it sound like Leon is on the run."<br><br>It's a good argument, but these guys don't get it.<br><br>Alan is really bullish because he thinks he is right. If he thinks that the girls around him are on his side, he will be bullish towards even Marie.<br><br>''It's His Highness Julius' volunteer army!"<br><br>"So what? In the first place--mug!"<br><br>Covering Marie's mouth with my hand, I decided to just shut her up for a while. She isn't making this situation better.<br><br>—The atmosphere in the school is already strange.<br><br>The eyes of the students around us are looking at us as if we are their enemies.<br><br>"Sorry, she's my fiancé and quite protective. "<br><br>When I say that she's my fiancé, Alan makes a blatantly disgusted face. In the school, boys who have fiancées are the winners of the marriage race.<br><br>They are the students who have won, and they are also the objects of jealousy for the boys who are still struggling to get married. Alan also has a frustrated look on his face.<br><br>I'm glad to see such a look on you.<br><br>"As for volunteering for the volunteer army, I'll consider it positively. I'm sorry we can't come to a decision sooner. I have a lot of preparations to make, too."<br><br>I'm going to decline in a positive way—that's a very Japanese reply in my previous life. It's the magic word that makes it sound like you're working on something positive, even though you have no intention of doing it.<br><br>Alan quickly turns his back on us and walks away.<br><br>"Make up your mind quickly. A poor nobleman in the countryside is only worth so much. You should be grateful you're allowed to join His Highness Julius' volunteer army in the first place."<br><br>Daniel and Raymond stare at Alan's back, and then quickly turn their gaze to me. Daniel looks frustrated.<br><br>"Leon, are you sure you want to keep this up?"<br><br>"We can't talk in here. Come with me."<br><br>"Hmmm! Hmm~!"<br><br>We walk out of the classroom with Marie, who’s flailing about.<br><br>The eyes of my classmates hurt.<br><br>◇<br><br>Alan and the others headed to the room where Jilk was.<br><br>Jilk narrows his eyes at the sight of Alan and his cronies, making no attempt to hide his discomfort.<br><br>"You backed down without them making any promises?"<br><br>The plan was to have Leon's airship sent out and made Julius's flagship. Leon had used Partner when fighting Countess Offley, and Jilk had heard about its performance.<br><br>If the Royal Palace wouldn't lend them the power to fight, they would have to procure it themselves.<br><br>Alan and the others make desperate excuses so as not to spoil Jilk's mood.<br><br>"I wouldn't be this pained if I could tell you that. But, His Highness Julius's flagship can be my ship. I can assure you of a comfortable sailing experience."<br><br>Alan is a student with a large war chest.<br><br>In addition to his airship, he lends his armor to his cronies and volunteers.<br><br>He is a valuable part of Julius's fleet. In fact, he is treated as an executive in Julius's volunteer army.<br><br>However, it was only the current situation that allowed him to become one.<br><br>But Jilk couldn't cut Alan off easily either.<br><br>''What I want is a warship, not a luxury cruise ship. You must immediately persuade Mr. Bartford to join us.''<br><br>"But..."<br><br>"You have to convince him. —I don't care how. Yes, I have heard that he had a sister. Why don't you talk to some of his other friends?"<br><br>Although he avoided being direct, what Jilk wanted to say was, "Threaten the people involved with him and use them to get him to cooperate."<br><br>Alan and the others leave the room in a hurry.<br><br>Jilk sees them off and enjoys a cup of his favorite tea in his favorite tea set.<br><br>"They are all useless subordinates. But they are risking their lives to become His Highness's subordinates, so we must be patient and use them. It's all for His Highness and—and Olivia-san."<br></span></p>
