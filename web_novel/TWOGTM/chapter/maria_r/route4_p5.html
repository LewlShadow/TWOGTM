              <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span><br>TN: I'm planning to release part 4 after I recover it. If anyone has saved it, please comment it down below.<br>I fixed a copy &amp; paste error. I accidentally posted two paragraphs together. Also, this IS part 5 &amp; 6. This has two more chapters than the norm.<br><span><a name="more"></a></span><br><br><br>The volunteer army, led by His Highness Julius, was fighting the rebels.<br>Watching the battle from the bridge of the airship, Olivia smiled inwardly. She enjoys watching her allied ships sink.<br>(Yes. Sacrifice your young lives in vain. If you're going to hold a grudge against someone, hold it against your ancestors for making you a noble.)<br>Julius was shouting at the crew.<br>"Bring this ship to the frontlines! Our flank is being beaten." (TN: It said side, but I wrote flank since that's the military term.)<br>"No! His Highness Julius has orders to not bring the flagship to the front!"<br>"Whose orders?!"<br>"His Majesty the King!"<br>"F**k!"<br>Out of concern for his allies, he tried to step forward. But when he found out it was an order by his father, His Majesty the King, he was forced to stop.<br>Olivia looked at Julius with a worried face.<br>Inwardly, however, she wasn't the least bit worried.<br>(I thought this battle would go on for longer, so this is disappointing. Still, seeing them fall is going to be interesting.)<br>On the battlefield, the students with their armor, were battling the rebels. The rebels were a group of renowned air bandits.<br>They were ordered to retreat if they encountered the regular army, but the volunteer army was easy pickings.<br>The volunteer soldiers were dropping like flies, by the hands of these experienced men. They were fighting by the textbook.<br>The air bandits were rewarded for every dead soldier, and therefore fought with tenacity.<br>This was ordered by Marquis Frampton—and Olivia.<br>Suddenly, Greg's voice was heard on the bridge.<br>It seems Greg boarded his armor and led his allies into battle.<br>"I'm going to help! You guys need support!"<br>Chris couldn't stand by either. He also led a group of students, with himself at the helm, into the battle.<br>"You just support them. I'm going to win this battle!"<br>As the two of them charged in, the bandits were pushed back. But they were experienced too, if you looked down on them, they could turn the tables.<br>Chris was chasing them around, sword in hand.<br>"Don't run from me coward! Fight me!"<br>Julius and Jilk showed the same expression at the sight of him.<br>"Is the bandits' morale low?"<br>"Your Highness, I think it's as high as it gets. Now let us rescue our allies."<br>Seeing Julius, who already knew the bitterness of defeat, even in his first battle, Olivia snuggled up to him.<br>"Julius, you, the commander can't look down. Everyone is watching."<br>"You're right. I'm not going to let some bandits defeat me."<br>Olivia smiled at Julius, who had recovered, but she was cold inside.<br>(It doesn't matter if you fall now anyways, since you're the last King of Holfort.)<br>◇<br>A collection point for supplies built on a floating island.<br>There, supplies were prepared to be delivered to each battlefield.<br>Airships frequently came and went.<br>They were in a hurry. The harbor was overflowed with people and cargo.<br>Marie and I were in a building in this port.<br>"We've been here so many times and yet, it's still always beautiful"<br>Marie watched the scene with admiration. Indeed, the scene of Armor modified for work carrying loads one after another seemed straight out of a sci-fi movie.<br>This is one of the reasons I enjoy this world so much.<br>How much better it would be, if it weren't war related.<br>"Don’t leave, you'll get lost."<br>"Don't be ridiculous!"<br>While teasing Marie, I entered a building to get my next order. In it I found a poster plastered on a large bulletin board.<br>No, it looked like a newspaper.<br>There was a crowd of people surrounding it.<br>"I heard His Highness won his first battle."<br>"He's fighting really well with just a volunteer army."<br>"It says he won three in a row."<br>The soldiers with the transport mission were shouting in admiration. It seems like His Highness's army was quite active.<br>Marie looked anxious.<br>"His Highness and the others aren't going to lose right?"<br>"Master said he's placed guards around His Highness, who will intervene if needed."<br>"If they're winning, they'll be fine. We won't all die, right? Right?"<br>Marie looked uneasy until she heard the answer from me.<br>"Maybe."<br>"Maybe? Tell me everything is fine here! How could you not know?　I'm insecure! I need you to take away my anxiety!"<br>"I'm an honest man and I'm a very reliable witness."<br>"Twisted bastard!"<br>I took the complaining Marie and headed to the room where the big man was.<br>As for the article I just read, I deliberately avoided negative topics.<br>How much damage has been done? I don't want to think about it too much.<br>I want it to be as fluffy and sweet as that otome game world. I'm hoping for a great turn of events where no one dies and they come back.<br>—What I'm concerned about is that they didn't talk about the damage in the game. I hope they're all safe, but I'm not sure what's really going on.<br>As we left, we stopped as we heard a topic of concern.<br>"Is the young girl on the battlefield too?"<br>"The Saint? They're saying she's the goddess of victory or something."<br>"Cute kid." (TN: Woah dude.)<br>When Marie heard Olivia's name, she was peeved.<br>"…'Saint', is it?"<br>"What, you're jealous? Come to think of it, someone tried to take the title of Saint and failed once."<br>I laughed at her, and Marie got pissed and denied it.<br>"It was just a dream! You're stupid forever!"<br>It was Marie who had tried to get into a meeting with His Highness Julius and the others in an attempt to replace Miss Olivia.<br>She even attempted made contact with them afterwards, but she failed every time.<br>It would mean that the mob would not be able to do their best, after all.<br>As I walked down the hallway talking to Marie, the building was emptied. Not just the soldiers, but even the knights walked out.<br>"What?"<br>I could hear the knights talking. One of the loudest ones was screaming to the puzzled knights.<br>"His Highness Julius is here!"<br>◇<br><br><br><br>Once His Highness Julius' arrived, he was warmly welcomed by the staff.<br>We poor aristocrats felt a bit alienated. After all, our highest priority was to resupply, not greet him.<br>Marie was back on board, but the boys had mixed expressions at the sight of the volunteer army.<br>I listened to Daniel and Raymonds' conversation as I surveyed the, now decreased in number, fleet.<br>"There were more than 10 ships at the start, right?"<br>"They must have gathered more after we left the academy, so there must have been more."<br>The others were also looking at His Highness with complicated expressions.<br>It's possible they routed, but if they didn't, chances are they sank.<br>"Consecutive victories, huh?"<br>Every ship except one was safe.<br>The safe one was the flagship.<br><br>◇<br>At the base of the port, Olivia was conversing with the Marquis.<br>Olivia held her glass and observed its contents.<br>"The Principality is acting quite laid back, isn't it?"<br>She was being sarcastic but the Marquis didn't mind making small talk.<br>"I see you've reduced the pirates by quite a bit."<br>"It wasn't really worth it."<br>"I've also seen His Highness. He's grown up a lot."<br>Olivia's shoulders shook. She was laughing inwardly. The Marquis craned his neck, puzzled by her attitude.<br>"What's so funny? He'll make a fine king, I'm sure."<br>"Yeah, I know."<br>Despite her verbal affirmation, Olivia was inwardly thinking the opposite.<br>(Can you really call that growth?)<br>The Kingdom was going to collapse, just like Olivia predicted.<br>"More importantly, will the Duke of Redgrave make a move?"<br>Are you going to war with them? The marquis took a sip of his wine before answering.<br>"It's been arranged for Vince to be the commander-in-chief. Our faction will not participate in the first group, so we won't get sacrificed. But I've managed to rake in the Redgrave house and some other frontier houses. They'll sacrifice themselves to take him down."<br>The Marquis is going to use this to weaken some nobles on the frontier too.<br>"While I'm at it, I'll remove all those who stand in my way. If no one joins me, others will get suspicious."<br>"They'll pull Vince down, and weaken themselves in the process. They may be a hindrance, but they'll serve us well."<br>"You're bad." (TN: Not that you're much better lol.)<br>Olivia raised her glass and smiled.<br>"I want this country and I'll do anything for it. And I'll be the Queen and you the Prime Minister. Let's continue to be friends, Prime Minister Frampton."<br>The Marquis was happy at those words.<br>"Of course, My Queen. No, My Saint."<br><br>The two smiled dimly, but it wasn't mutual trust. They were hungry to use each other.<br><br>◇</span></span>
