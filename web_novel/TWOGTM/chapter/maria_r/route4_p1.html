              TN: This one is really long so I'll be releasing it in parts.<br>
              Translator: Fr06t<br>
              Editor: Fr06t<br>
              _________________________________________________________________________________<br>
              <br>
              "Now the kingdom is facing its greatest crisis ever!"<br>
              <br>
              It was His Royal Highness Julius who was standing on a platform in the square in front of the school gates, giving a speech.<br>
              <br>
              After school.<br>
              <br>
              Students returning to their dormitories and those about to go out into the city to play stop and listen to His Highness Julius' speech.<br>
              <br>
              The reason is because they're obligated to hear him out. That's the reason most of them are here.<br>
              <br>
              However, some of them are joining in with great enthusiasm.<br>
              <br>
              His Highness Julius added gestures and raised his voice as he looked around at the faces of the crowd. 'You're used to making speeches,' is how I—Leon Fou Bartford—felt.<br>
              <br>
              "I'm sure everyone has heard of the continuing rebellion in many places. I'm sure everyone is anxious, but don't worry. The army of our Holfort Kingdom is on its way to put them down."<br>
              <br>
              Even though sophomore year is nearing its end, the military is dealing with a series of rebellion's in various parts of the Holfort Kingdom.<br>
              <br>
              It's not uncommon for the nobles to have skirmishes within the country. So normally the students don’t panic as long as their own safety was not in danger.<br>
              <br>
              However—if it happened frequently in different parts of the country, they would become uneasy, even if they didn't want to.<br>
              <br>
              In fact, the female students listening to His Highness Julius's speech seemed anxious.<br>
              <br>
              "There was an uprising near my parents' home, too."<br>
              <br>
              "There are many of them these days."<br>
              <br>
              "I got a letter from my parent's telling me to stay in Kings Landing for the long weekend"<br>
              <br>
              Many students felt uneasy.<br>
              <br>
              His Royal Highness Julius' speech in such a situation attracted the students.<br>
              <br>
              "Our country is strong! Don't be afraid of the frequent uprisings! But—"<br>
              <br>
              Julius closed his eyes and made a little pause.<br>
              <br>
              His eyes widen and he says in a louder voice than before<br>
              <br>
              "—There's a country that's working behind the scenes."<br>
              <br>
              As the crowd began to buzz, His Highness Julius just shut his mouth.<br>
              <br>
              In the midst of the commotion, Marie Fou Lovan, who was next to me, looked at His Highness Julius, stunned.<br>
              <br>
              ''Hey, are you okay?''<br>
              <br>
              When I called out to her, Marie had a huff and puff look on her face. I'm sure Marie remembers this scene. Of course, I remember it too.<br>
              <br>
              Towards the end of the middle of that otome game, the real enemy is revealed. At that point, His Royal Highness Julius will make a speech.<br>
              <br>
              When the crowd is quiet, His Highness Julius resumes his speech.<br>
              <br>
              'The Principality—the Principality of Fanoss—is behind the frequent rebellions.<br>
              <br>
              The spectators were amazed at the new revelation and shouted.<br>
              <br>
              The fact that behind the uprising commotion is the Principality, which has a longstanding hostile relationship with the Holfort Kingdom, is highly credible.<br>
              <br>
              Amidst the commotion, I talk with Marie. To confirm our knowledge of the game and to see what we're going to do.<br>
              <br>
              "The Principality didn't stop, did it?"<br>
              <br>
              "Why won't they stop? You stole their trump card, didn't you? And yet, what's the point of not stopping the war?"<br>
              <br>
              I'm not going to fight because I don't think I can win. This type of decision seems simple, but it's actually quite difficult.<br>
              <br>
              We were naive in thinking that we could avoid a war by capturing the magic flute, the Principality's trump card.<br>
              <br>
              Last time, in order to avoid the war, we rode into the Principality of Fanoss and retrieved the Magic Flute. It's a tool that summons that otome game's last boss, and it's an extremely troublesome item.<br>
              <br>
              Without the flute, we thought the war would end. But in the end, we couldn't avoid it.<br>
              <br>
              ''Leon, are you going to join the war?''<br>
              <br>
              Marie also knows what happens after this.<br>
              <br>
              What awaits after this—<br>
              <br>
              "Everyone, do me a favor."<br>
              <br>
              —When His Highness Julius held out his hands, he looked divine and radiant.<br>
              <br>
              After all, a good-looking man is always popular. I'm sure no one would listen to me if I were to make a speech.<br>
              <br>
              "This crisis—I want to stop this crisis in the Kingdom. Not as the crown prince. I want to save the kingdom from danger, as Julius, as a knight! That's what I'm asking for. Please lend me your help!"<br>
              <br>
              The Crown Prince, as a knight, said he wants to save the day.<br>
              <br>
              The students were impressed by that.<br>
              <br>
              There are voices calling out his name from everywhere.<br>
              <br>
              ''Long live His Highness Julius!''<br>
              <br>
              "Long live the kingdom!"<br>
              <br>
              "I can help you!"<br>
              <br>
              Gradually the crowd became invaded by the heat and raised their voices.<br>
              <br>
              “Thank you. Thank you guys! Lend me your power and I will survive this crisis. I—No, we will save the country!”<br>
              <br>
              Julius raised his voice at one point, and the crowd responded with a voice that made the air shake. My ears were aching.<br>
              <br>
              Marie looked at it in horror. It seemed hard to understand.<br>
              <br>
              "Why do you want to go to war?"<br>
              <br>
              It was a scene that had been talked about like a beautiful story in that maiden game, but up close and personal, it seemed to be a different scene somehow. There was no emotion there.<br>
              <br>
              It was just scary.<br>
              <br>
              I wonder if Marie is the same, and she squeezes my hand.<br>
              <br>
              "You don't think you're going to die, do you? Well, the aristocrats are the ones who stand back and give orders on the battlefield. They don't have much of a sense of urgency."<br>
              <br>
              "And you?"<br>
              <br>
              "Me? I hate it. If I don't have to fight a war, I won't."<br>
              <br>
              Marie had a look of relief on her face. Did she think I would be willing to join in? In the first place, student soldiers would be a nuisance to professional soldiers and knights.<br>
              <br>
              They wouldn't want to be seen on the battlefield when they hadn't even trained well.<br>
              <br>
              His Highness Julius waved his hand at the enthusiastic crowd.<br>
              <br>
              It was a scene that was quite exciting in the game, but seeing it in person made me feel somewhat empty, sad, and complicated.<br>
              <br>
              Are these guys really going to join the war?<br>
              <br>
              ◇<br>
              <br>
              After a few days had passed since His Highness Julius' speech, the atmosphere in the school had changed drastically.<br>
              <br>
              The tense air that had been tense due to the rebellion was now buoyed by the heat.<br>
              <br>
              The boys who wanted to take this opportunity to make a name for themselves had announced in high spirits in the classroom that they would be volunteering for His Highness Julius' army.<br>
              <br>
              "Alan, the son of the Viscount Bourdons, volunteers for the army of His Highness Julius! Anyone else want to join me?"<br>
              <br>
              If they joined with a bunch of people, they would be better remembered by His Highness Julius. This was their ulterior motive.<br>
              <br>
              Also, if you volunteer with a large number of people, you in the army of His Highness Julius—shall we call it a volunteer army? It would have been a volunteer army in that otome game.<br>
              <br>
              Your position in the volunteer army is also taken into account.<br>
              <br>
              If you join alone, you're one of the soldiers, but if you take ten men with you, you're a captain.<br>
              <br>
              Also, rumor has it that if you send out armor and airships with the support of your parents' family, you will be treated as an officer.<br>
              <br>
              Lots of boy's want to join for their future.<br>
              <br>
              One after another, boys from the advanced and normal classes had volunteered to join.<br>
              <br>
              I was surrounded by Daniel and Raymond, who were also poor aristocrats from the countryside, watching the scene from a distance.<br>
              <br>
              Both of them were looking coldly at me.<br>
              <br>
              It's kind of sad that the country aristocrats are more aware of the reality of the situation.<br>
              <br>
              Daniel let out a sigh as he looked at the boys who were floating around.<br>
              <br>
              ''For the sake of the country, for the sake of your highness, their tatemae are splendid, aren't they?" (TN: tatemae means a person's true feelings. It's meaning is similar to ulterior motive. In this case, Daniel is being sarcastic and saying their true feelings are sincere when in actuality, they're all just in it for the recognition.)<br>
              <br>
              Raymond pushes his glasses up with his middle finger and when he adjusts his position, he talks about the boys' true feelings.<br>
              <br>
              "If you're active here, you'll be popular with the girls. There are a lot of boys who will stick around for this reason."<br>
              <br>
              What a sad reality.<br>
              <br>
              I saw a boy named Alan making a scene in the classroom. He's a boy who wears ornaments and looks like a rich man. He is surrounded by his cronies.<br>
              <br>
              I'm sure he's going to put on a fine airship and armor with the support of his parents' family.<br>
              <br>
              Are the students, whose families are poor, going to borrow weapons from Alan to fight in the war? Well, that's not our problem.<br>
              <br>
              "Daniel, Raymond, do you guys want to join in?"<br>
              <br>
              I joked, and they both snickered.<br>
              <br>
              "No,"<br>
              <br>
              "Let's get real. It's not good for amateurs to be on the battlefield. I think the only one of us who's allowed to participate properly is Leon."<br>
              <br>
              "Me?"<br>
              <br>
              Raymond, who made it sound like I'm the only exception, shrugged his shoulders and explained why.<br>
              <br>
              ''It was Leon who broke off the two families of Viscount Raffan and Count Offley, right?" (TN: These guys will probably be talked about in volume 6. Unless I'm wrong, in which case please tell me.)<br>
              <br>
              "Oh~ that was my brother. Nix is a really great guy. You guys were watching him, weren't you? You guys were in on it, too."<br>
              <br>
              Yeah, right. Leon was the one working in the background. I mean, we were the ones sending out the airships.<br>
              <br>
              Let's just say that I'm only here to support my brother in making a name for himself. I didn't sacrifice my brother because I didn't want to stand out.<br>
              <br>
              I'm a kind brother who's happy to see my brother get ahead. —No offense.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Daniel laughed.<br>
              <br>
              "I envy the Baldfart family because they are all heroes. But you've made a name for yourself by attacking dungeons. You even have an airship; a lot of students know that."<br>
              <br>
              Will they be pressing me to join them?<br>
              <br>
              It's really annoying.<br>
              <br>
              "I wish I could run away."<br>
              <br>
              "I'm not sure they want you. The rich people want to play an active role themselves. They don't want Leon to take all the credit, do they?"<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              "You think they care more about taking credit for the war than winning it?"<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              "It's too good a volunteer army."<br>
              <br>
              "People dream too much, don't they?"<br>
              <br>
              If you play an active role on the battlefield and come back to the school, the girls won't leave you alone—what a dream! Besides, if you play an active role here, your future will be open.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              His Highness Julius will remember you better, and you'll be able to tell the saga of your activities since your school days.<br>
              <br>
              They don't have to push themselves. Seeing the boys trying to go to war makes me feel empty.<br>
              <br>
              Let the adults take care of it. When we grow up, they can make us participate in the war even if we don't want to, but what are we going to do about it right now?<br>
              <br>
              We should have more fun while we are young.<br>
              <br>
              We should not go to war. <br>
              <br>
              ◇ <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              A special building has been prepared on the school grounds. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              It is a house, not a dormitory, prepared for Olivia. It was prepared for her, and only a few people are allowed to enter. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Armed guards were prepared around the building, and Olivia received special treatment. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              But right now, the master is absent. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              The people using such a building were the nobles who represented the school. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Julius has a map in front of him that is placed on the table. Several pieces that resembled airships were placed and looked at them. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              At Julius's side, Jilk is preparing a cup of tea. <br>
              <br>
              "Your Highness, is there something troubling you?" <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Julius responds to Jilk's question by rubbing his fingers over his eyes. Julius's problem is that there are too many volunteers. <br>
              <br>
              ''Lots of students volunteered, but the problem is the equipment."<br>
              <br>
              "Is it still difficult to rent it from the royal court?" <br>
              <br>
              "Father and Mother only told me to stay at the school. I can't believe that the King is looking at me with his finger in his mouth during this time of crisis." <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              One by one, the rebels rose up, and even the Principality took advantage of the opportunity to attack. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              In this time of crisis, Julius has decided to fight on his own. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              The reason for this—Olivia. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Jilk laughed as if teasing Julius. <br>
              <br>
              ''Aren't you just trying to show Olivia-san your good side?" <br>
              <br>
              Don't be a fool! <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Julius, who was flustered, forced himself to return the conversation with a deliberate coughing fit, but that just proved Jilks' point. <br>
              <br>
              ''Jilk, we're short on weapons. What about the other three? <br>
              <br>
              "They're still gathering their strength back at home." <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              The other three are Brad, the heir to the Field family. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Greg, the heir to the Seberg family. <br>
              <br>
              Chris, the son of a swordsman. <br>
              <br>
              All three of them are heirs to powerful nobles and are strong allies who agree with Julius. At the same time, they were also love rivals for Olivia. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Julius puts his hand on his chin and looks down at the map. Then he tells Jilk his decision. <br>
              <br>
              ''We will participate in this battle, and we will lead the kingdom to victory." <br>
              <br>
              "Yes, Your Highness." <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Jilk agreed. He then suggested to Julius. <br>
              <br>
              "Your Highness, why don't you ask the students who own airships to help you?" <br>
              <br>
              "Own an airship? Are there any students who do?" <br>
              <br>
              "There are very few, but they exist. With their help, we can assemble a fleet of airships. Some of the students have armor, you know" <br>
              <br>
              "Would it be better to have their help now?" <br>
              <br>
              "Yes. After all, this is a matter of national importance." <br>
              <br>
              "All right. You're in charge. But don't push yourself." <br>
              <br>
              "You can count on me, Your Highness."
