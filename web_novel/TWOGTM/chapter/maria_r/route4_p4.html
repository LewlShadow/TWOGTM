              <p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>&nbsp;TN: The sites back up, but please don't visit. I'm not sure of the problem but it could threaten your pc too. I'll be putting it on maintenance mode but that doesn't stop you from going there.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"></span></p><a name="more"></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span><br></span></span><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"The palace doesn't give a damn."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Gritting his teeth in the empty room, Jilk was in a hurry because his planned plan to make Partner his flagship had gone awry.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"If I don't do this, I'll cause trouble for Olivia-san in the royal palace. If I do that, my existence is worthless!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>He held his head in his hands.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>He was acting impatient and breathing erratically.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Jilk didn't want Olivia to dislike him at all.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>He pondered what to do, and then thought about getting a replacement airship.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Let's scrounge up some airships, even if it's a bit heavy-handed. We've been too lax in the past. This is a battle for the honor of Your Highness. We can't afford to embarrass him."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>For Julius' sake, for Olivia's sake—he repeated the same excuses in his head and decided to scrape up the strength, even if it was somewhat forceful.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The plan is to have the students procure it (TN: supplies, and armors and stuff) for each other.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Of course, Jilk has no right to make them do that.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>However, this plan can be realized. All you have to do is create an atmosphere in the school where they will be forced to provide it themselves. If they don't provide it, he can drive them away as having no noble spirit.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>It's pretty vicious, but Jilk doesn't hesitate.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>He puts on a cold expression and leaves the room.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The port where Partner is anchored is packed with people from the poor nobility.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Both men and women are participating in the war as my volunteer army, to make a track record of participating in the war and—to escape from the school, which is surrounded by a bizarre atmosphere.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>I watched from the deck as the people I knew boarded from the ramp.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>I could hear Marie's voice. Marie is trying to get the girls she knows aboard."Come on, get aboard! Hurry up!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Marie, you're scaring me~"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>She pushed the small girl hugging the book and forced her onto the partner.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Just get in! If you were at school, you'd be holed up in the library, right?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Yes."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Why are you taking what she said for granted? I looked at the girls who responded like that and I watched, thinking that Marie must be feeling troubled too.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Behind Marie, there were girls who followed behind her— reluctantly following her. They must have been forced out of the school by the atmosphere too.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>—But more importantly, aren't there a lot of them? There were more girls than Marie was taking care of before.<br>Marie doesn't have it easy either.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The girls that Marie is taking care of have a strong habit of taking care of themselves.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The boys in my group are looking at them like hungry beasts.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"If you get on Leon-senpai's airship, you'll have a chance to talk to them!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"You're kidding me?! Give this place up to your seniors!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I don't know! If it comes to this, it's a duel!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Everyone's eyes are bleary-eyed because their lives are at stake. They ignore the hierarchy and fight each other, which is a sight to behold.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>She might be a reclusive girl who loves books, but compared to the noble girls at school, her flaws are more attractive. Love books? I'll buy as many as I can! That's what we boys are all about. It's tens of thousands of times better than being asked for precious metals, giving them away, and then them being sold to a pawn shop a few days later.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>—again, I think the school is a sad existence for the boys.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>In addition to the girls that Marie is taking care of, there are other girls from the poor aristocracy that come aboard. They must have sensed the atmosphere in the school and fled.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"There's a larger group than I expected."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"The current atmosphere at the school is intolerable."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>As I look down at such a scene from the deck, Luxion approaches me.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"It's been a while,"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Why did you call me, master?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I've got a lot on my plate. More importantly, have you finished your errands?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Not yet."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"You should prioritize this then."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Partner's performance is enough to serve the purpose without me. Besides, I'll leave Arroganz behind"<br>Arroganz—the armor prepared exclusively for me is larger than the standard armor in this world.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"You're going to leave your master alone?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Are you lonely? Don't worry. We have artificial intelligence on board the Arroganz, and we have drones in place in Partner. You have nothing to worry about."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Lately, Luxion has been busy, flying around from place to place, away from my side. If I tell him I miss him for that, he'll say something sarcastic again, so I'll keep quiet.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Artificial intelligence in the Arroganz? Your replica?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I'm sorry, but there's no way to replicate my kind of high-performance artificial intelligence in a space as small as Arroganz."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>It's like he's trying to tell me he's a genius.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"But I can assure you that it is better than master."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"You're a real loudmouth. —and how did the investigation of the saint's necklace go?</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"The investigation is currently on hold due to low priority."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I want to know what's going on in the country. Make it a priority"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I've already collected the magic flute. Isn't it unnecessary? Instead, our priority is to destroy the remains of the new humans. That is an objective that should be achieved."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>As usual, he has no mercy for new humans. In a way, is it typical of Luxion? If you look at the harbor, drones are in the process of loading and unloading cargo.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>To the untrained eye, it would look like they were using their armor to load and unload their cargo.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Luxion, stay, we need your help,"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The current situation continued to be unpredictable, and I couldn't help but feel uneasy on my own. That's why I'm giving orders to Luxion—</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I'm judging it to be unnecessary. I don't think my performance will be needed. More importantly, if we leave the remains of the newcomers unattended and a problem arises, it will be a disaster. Like the master said, there is a possibility that the world could be destroyed."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Really?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>He's saying that if we leave the remains of the new mankind unattended, the world will be destroyed. I don't think this guy is going to lie to me, so should I make that a priority?</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I'll be back as soon as I can. —I'll be back as soon as I can. I'm sure Master will miss me."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"—That's quite an assumption."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>I watched Luxion leave and I looked up at the sky.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Is it really going to be this simple?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Holfort.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>There, Olivia is meeting with a traitor named Marquis of Frampton. The Marquess of Frampton himself believes himself to be a patriot who has sacrificed himself for his country, and he has no doubt about it.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>But the way he did save the country could not be called patriotic.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Such was the Marquis of Frampton - Olivia. No, I don't hate saints. It's because she's more useful than the rest of us.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"It seems that Jilk is trying hard, too. He's doing some cute things so that I like him."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>As Olivia read the report, the Marquis of Frampton was dismayed.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"You're receiving complaints every day from the nobles who have their children in the school,"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Once Julius goes to war, there will be less complaints. It's a great honor to be part of the Crown Princes' first battle. Isn't it?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Well, I guess I'll just have to shut up. But do you really want to send His Highness Julius to war? He doesn't have any formal training, you know?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>He wasn't actually worried about Julius, but rather about the palanquin she carried.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>It's the same with Olivia.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"There are plenty of alternatives available." (TN: For these paragraphs, it's kind of hard to express so I'll put the gist of it here: Olivia is sending Julius to war so he can distinguish himself, and he can become a better pawn. But, in the case he fails and dies or something, she's saying she can find an alternative. As long as she has the saints item she's fine with whatever.)</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"You really are a terrible woman. For you to be a saint, this must be the end of the world."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>At those words, Olivia laughed at the corners of her mouth in a position where the Marquis of Frampton couldn't see her. Her eyes were glazed over.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>(You're right. It's the end of the world for the Kingdom of Holfort.)</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The saint in Olivia, who acts to destroy the kingdom of Holfort, orders the Marquis of Frampton.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I'll be on the battlefield too. Prepare me a ship were I can use my power."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Are you sure? It's a student-controlled fleet. You know how much damage you could do..."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"It's convenient. I'm leaving now."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The Marquis of Frampton stopped moving for a moment in front of Olivia's uncharacteristic childlike spirit. Immediately afterwards, he nodded impatiently.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Okay."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>As Olivia walked out of the room, Kyle, who was waiting outside, approached her.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Gosh, Master, where to next?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Olivia replies to the question from a nervous Kyle with a smile on her face."I'll follow Julius on his first battle. Kyle will be taking care of me too, so follow me."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Yes!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Even though she was heading to the battlefield, Olivia didn't show the slightest bit of panic.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>It was because the saint had experienced this many times in the past.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Good job, Arroganz!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"There! There! A little more to the right!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Partner's hangar.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Me and Marie were cheering on the unmanned, moving Arroganz.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>As for what Aroganz is doing—.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"—Miss."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>—admitting that he made a mistake himself, he watched as the crates, stacked in a huge body, crumbled.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Arroganz is playing with the crates left over from the transport of supplies, using them as building blocks. —not.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Arroganz is gaining experience.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Arroganz, newly equipped with artificial intelligence, moves poorly. If it walks, it scrapes. If it flies, it falls for some reason. When he plays with blocks, he fails.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>He's still like a tottering baby.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Such is the case with Arroganz as he heads for the corner of the hangar.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Arroganz?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Marie calls out to him, and he sits down with his back to us and stares at the wall.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"What's the matter with you, Arroganz? Are you sulking?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Marie approaches and tries to get him to stand, but the weapon, Arroganz, doesn't freak out. And yet, he makes an excuse.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"—Recalculating."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"You're sulking, aren't you? You're definitely sulking! Come on, baby, do it again. You can do it again. Arroganz can do it!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>I was sitting on the crate watching Marie, who was desperately trying to encourage Arroganz.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The reason I'm watching the two of them interact is because I'm basically bored.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Even though we're out on the battlefield, we students are on a mission to transport supplies in the rear.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The regular army doesn't consider us a force, and we were told to never go into battle.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>We should be glad that there are sane adults left in the field.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Raymond comes to the hangar.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Leon, we're about to arrive. Huh? Is Arroganz still playing with blocks?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Isn't it cute?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>When I bragged about my no-good, cute Arroganz, Raymond didn't seem to understand.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I don't believe in armour that works unattended. It's not like it's got a ghost on it or anything, is it?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Raymond and his friends didn't understand when I told them that Arroganz is equipped with artificial intelligence.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Thanks to this, there are rumors that the Arroganz is carrying a ghost.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The only people who come close to him are me and Marie.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>I get out of the crate and call out to Marie and Arroganz.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"We're about to arrive. We're about to start unloading and you can get some rest."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Recalculation is complete."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I'll tell Arroganz to practice while I'm gone."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Just get some rest. We're going working."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>When Marie came toward me, she put her hands on her hips. It's Marie's outfit, but since it's strange to be in uniform in a hangar, she's in her ties.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I'm going to go talk to all the girls,"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Do you want me to help you?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"Of course! If you leave them alone, a lot of the boys go to their rooms. Besides, the boys work harder when they're around."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>The boys who want to look good in front of girls will work even harder than usual</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Men are sad creatures, aren't they?</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Raymond laughs.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I don't blame them for doing so. Well, I'm going to go and talk to the guys."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>In the hangar where they left, I look up at Arroganz.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"I don't think anything will come to pass, but if it something does happen, please lend me some help."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>"…acknowleged."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>Arroganz responds briefly, raises his arms high—and hits the hanger crane. This robot is a big ditz.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span>MobuSeka V6SS1 Part 4</span></span></p>
