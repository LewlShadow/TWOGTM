              <p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Translator: Fr06t</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face=""><span>Editor: Fr06t<br></span></span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The Royal Castle of the Principality of Vanoss.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Hertrude was getting ready to lead their fleet into battle. There were maidservants around to help her get dressed, with no men in sight. It was her sister, Hertrauda, who barged into the room.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Sister, please listen to me just once!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Hertrude takes one look at Hertrauda's face and returns her gaze to the mirror disinterestedly.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"It's annoying, but without the magic flute the Principality will fall apart—"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Why does that matter?!</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"You are royalty, what are you saying?!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Hertrude was enraged by Hertrauda's words, which made even the maidservants uneasy. She glares at her sister with a sharp look in her eyes and slaps her as she approaches. A dry thud echoes through the room and the maidservant's distance themselves from the two. The head maidservant tries to warn Hertrude but she ignores her.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Stand back, I have a lot of things to teach my inadequate sister."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The head chamberlain stops her in a hurry—</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"But we must hurry!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Just leave."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The maidservants follow the command of Hertrude, intimidated by her tone, and leave the room.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Hertrauda looks at her sister with teary eyes, in the empty room.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"What was that remark? If you say something like that, the people will think they have been abandoned. Hertrauda, do you understand? You are to be the Queen if I don't return. I can't leave you in charge if you continue such behavior."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Sister, please listen to me."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"That won't be necessary—I'll be leaving."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">As Hertrude turned to leave the room, she signals with her hand to Hertrauda. Once Hertrude sees the look on Hertrauda's face, she feels relieved.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"I'll have Hertrauda reflect on this, don't let her leave the room."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Yes, Your Highness."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">(I won't let anyone touch Hertrauda.)</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Locked in Hertrude's room, Hertrauda understood what the signal meant.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">She found a letter prepared in advance and read it.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"—Sister…"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Tears spill out of her eyes as she reads it. On it, was an apology for Hertrude's previous attitude. It also said that there was no one she could trust. She doesn't know where they're watching from, so be careful. Added in the letter were the names of some suspicious vassals.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The first was Count Gerrat.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Sitting on the bed, Hertrauda clutches the letter with tears in her eyes. At the end of it, Hertrude requests her to burn it.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">She might have to burn her sister's last letter.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Everything will be taken from me…"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"We are supposed to be royalty, yet…"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">She had just been informed of her powerlessness.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Going up to the fireplace, Hertrauda burns the letter.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">After doing so, she cries and sobs in frustration.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">A military base at the goods depot.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Partner, who was ordered to stay on standby, was finally given a mission. I'm the one who talks with him, since Marie is busy with Arroganz.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">There's an important man throwing orders in front of me. His attitude is clearly looking down on me, but this great man seems to be a noble. He's probably some far back in the succession line. He is definitely not happy with his assignment with commander of the goods depot.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"The Principality has moved, you volunteer army, go deliver supplies to the frontline."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"The Principality of Vanoss?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Yes."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Just us? Without an escort?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"You think we have the wherewithal to do that on this base? We're busy over here. In a few days, new volunteer soldiers will arrive from the academy. We're busy preparing to receive them."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">This base commander, he's trying to win over His Highness. I guess he's working hard, if His Highness remembers him here, he might make it to the top.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">However, there's some information I couldn't ignore.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"More volunteer soldiers are coming?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"After hearing about His Highness's victory, the remaining cowards seemed to have lifted a heavy hand. Other young nobles who graduated from the academy will also participate. We're planning to form a large fleet."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The commander, with no choice, is helping the organization of the fleet.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Are they still going to rake in more students, after all the damage?</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Moreover, they're fighting the regular army of the Principality.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">As if the base commander thought he couldn't stay with me forever, he told me to get out of here.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">When I left the room, I caught sight of a familiar face. It was the knight I saw at my brother Nix's castle.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Long time no see, Leon-sama."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Yeah, hi."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The knight held out a letter from nix.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"A letter from our lord to Master Leon."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"My brother?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"My lord has been asked to participate in this battle, he has been entrusted with the first line of defense."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">I hurriedly skimmed the letter. It seems a lot of things were rushed while I was nonchalantly resting in Partner.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The letter states that the palace has ordered Nix and Father to join the battle.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"It is an order from the Crown. The same goes for provincial barons or barons."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">It can be seen that they are scrambling for strength in a great hurry. After all, the rebels are running rampant in many places. The regular army can't handle it.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">—it's like the same scenario as in the game.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">In that otome game, the Redgrave family, who led the first group, should have been defeated. So Angelica's family would have failed.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">That's why, it's not good to have my dad and brother there.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">I don't want my dad to die, and if my brother dies, I feel sorry for my newly married sister-in-law Dorothea. I can't say this is a good scenario.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The letter said to take care of the rest if you need anything else, but I squeezed it.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Master Leon, why are you squeezing the letter?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Nix's knight is upset so I tell him what I'm going to do.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"We're going to participate. We're already planning to deliver supplies to the frontlines. I'm sure the rural nobles in the volunteer army want to support their parents."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The other guy is like, "What is he talking about?".</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">It can't be helped; I'm not going to leave it to the Redgrave family. Damn it! If only Luxion was here. He could gather more information.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">That guy is useless at the most important points.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">◇</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">In the fort-like building in the goods depot, the students of the volunteer army led by Julius were holding feast.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">There were no knights or soldiers to stop them. Partly because of Julius's position, but also because they had heard the losses of the volunteer army.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">In the banquet hall, Julius acted cheerfully.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"My fellow warriors! Thanks to you, our army has won a series of battles! Now, let us enjoy the feast!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Long live Prince Julius!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"We're the best of the volunteers!" (TN: Well, technically you're the only volunteers…)</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Even the Principality can be beaten!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The volunteers, raised their mugs and answering Julius's voice, were drinking like they were bathing in alcohol. They were making fools of themselves.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">However, compared to the early days, there were fewer of them. With each battle, the number of those Julius called his comrades-in-arms would dwindle. As a result, they were reduced to about half.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Every time they fought, many of them lost their lives, and even the executive class students who participated with their airships were killed in the battle.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Alan was not here either.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Lloyd was also not here. (TN: Everyone in the comments called it, lol.)</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Greg, and Chris and Brad and the others had formed their own groups and were drinking.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Julius is approached by Jilk.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Only Julius and the other noblemen—the boys who weren't the targets of the attack—were safe.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Your Highness, the report arrived just now."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Oh, how'd it go?"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"New volunteers are arriving from the school. Even the alumni heard of our successes."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The banquet hall is in full swing at the report of a smiling Jilk.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Julius stood on a chair and drew the attention of those around him.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Did you all hear what Jilk just said? Our exploits have reached the Capital! Let us continue to fight a decisive battle against the Principality, and have our name engraved in the history of the kingdom!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">The banquet hall was filled with the excitement of the students.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Julius put a hand to his chest.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"And let us pray for our dead comrades in arms. They were brave. They will continue to watch over us."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">As the audience gets excited, Greg raises his voice.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">"Our passed friends would like it too! Come on, people! Let's gain a big victory and make sure our dead comrades aren't forgotten!"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">Once again, the banquet hall was in full swing.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">It was as if they were daring to make a lot of noise to force themselves to forget the events on the battlefield.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="">◇</span></span></p>
